`GitHub WARNING`: This is a __mirror repo__ from [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/distributopia/fetch-the-badge). Please, send your MRs there. Issues can still be opened here and are welcome.

> This is a collection of sweet badges for fedizens.

Does your repo need more individuality than "build : passing"?

#### [DEMO page](https://distributopia.gitlab.io/fetch-the-badge)

## How to use

Demo page is currently hosted by GitLab pages. Extensive use of badges as `<img>` sources might be regarded as hotlinking, so we wouldn't encourage it. You can grab SVGs from [badges](/public/badges) folder and host them somewhere.

If you wish to use a badge on your website page, and not on a GitHub repo, insert SVG directly into your HTML.

## Contributing

Don't hesitate to suggest text for new badges in issues or via merge requests in the main [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/distributopia/fetch-the-badge) repo. In case of MR, please, also include a new gradient for your badge.

Please, try to avoid mainstream badge texts. For fun badges go [here](https://forthebadge.com). For common badges go [there](https://shields.io). Also check out [ethical design](https://ind.ie/ethical-design) badges.
